Princess Engine
============

This is an open source NES platformer engine that powers Nova the Squirrel ([Design details here](http://wiki.novasquirrel.com/Princess%20Engine)). It's named because it's similar in purpose to the [President](http://pineight.com/mw/index.php?title=President) engine.

Right now things need to be worked to be generic and be a better starting-off point. This engine will provide something much more legal to play with than hacking a game in the Mario series. In addition, unlike with Super Mario World, all the tools as well as the game itself are completely open source, and GPL licensed.
